## About Me

Hi, my name is Ka I (pronounced "e") Chan. I am a Master's student in [Data Science and Information Technology](https://gix.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University, where I am grateful to be advised by Prof. [Yuanchun Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TZm3-pwAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/en/). I am also currently being advised by Prof. [Saeed Abdullah](https://saeedabdullah.com/) at Penn State, exploring financial behaviors related to bipolar disorder using NLP techniques. Previously, I graduated magna cum laude from Tsinghua University with a B.S. in [Psychology](https://www.psych.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxxen/).

My research interest lies in **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, with a specific focus on **health, wellbeing, aging and accessibility**. My research goal is to understand people's needs and challenges, particularly among vulnerable populations, and to design and develop AI-driven systems that empower and enhance people's health and wellbeing.

In my daily life, I have a strong interest in various sports, with powerlifting being a particular focus. I am also passionate about music. I used to play the piano and guitar and was a percussion member of the Tsinghua University Symphonic Band.
