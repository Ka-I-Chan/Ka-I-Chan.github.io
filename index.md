## About Me 

Hi, my name is Ka I (pronounced "e") Chan, a Master's student in Data Science and Information Technology at Tsinghua University. I am grateful to be advised by 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TZm3-pwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Yuanchun Shi</a> and 
<a href="https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/en/" target="_blank">Prof. Yuntao Wang</a> at the 
<a href="https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Pervasive Interaction (PI) Lab</a>. 
I have also been fortunate to work with 
<a href="https://orsonxu.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Xuhai "Orson" Xu</a>, 
<a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhiconlu/" target="_blank">Prof. Zhicong Lu</a>, 
<a href="https://saeedabdullah.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Saeed Abdullah</a>, and 
<a href="https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1477.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Jiangtao Gong</a>. 
Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University with a B.S. in Psychology.

My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and health informatics. I am passionate about understanding the practices, behaviors and needs of vulnerable and marginalized populations. My goal is to design, develop, and deploy AI/ML systems, applications, and interventions that empower these groups, enhancing overall health and well-being. 

In my daily life, I enjoy various sports and have a passion on music. I used to play the piano and guitar and was a percussion member of the Tsinghua University Symphonic Band. 

My CV is available <a href="assets/files/KaIChan_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
