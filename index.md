## About Me

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.

Hi, my name is Ka I (pronounced "e") Chan. I am a Master's student in Data Science and Information Technology at Tsinghua University, where I am very grateful to be advised by Prof. [Yuanchun Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TZm3-pwAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/en/) at the [HCILab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). Previously, I graduated magna cum laude from Tsinghua University with a B.S. in Psychology.

My research interest lies in human-computer interaction (HCI), with a specific focus on health, wellbeing, aging and accessibility. My research goal is to understand people's needs and challenges, particularly among vulnerable populations, and to design and develop AI-driven systems that empower and enhance people's health and wellbeing.
